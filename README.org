* Anki Super Vocab

[[file:image/superVocabDemo.gif]]

This repository provides a beautifully designed Anki note type for efficient vocabulary learning, particularly for languages like English.
The note type is based on [[https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1678116644][English vocab (note type)]], which is very underrated and not widely known.
It helps you learn new words by providing definitions, example sentences, pronunciation information, mnemonics, and more.
This repo also includes a snippet and example org file to create notes in org-mode and export them to Anki by using [[https://github.com/anki-editor/anki-editor][anki-editor]].

** Features

- *Beautifully Designed HTML:*  The cards are visually appealing and easy to read.
- *Two Card Types:*
    1.  *Word -> Meaning:*  Tests your ability to recall the definition of a given word.
    2.  *Meaning -> Word:*  Tests your ability to recall the word given its definition.
- *Automatic Cloze Deletion (Meaning -> Word):*
  In the "Meaning -> Word" card type, the target word is automatically cloze-deleted (blanked out) within the example sentences provided in the "Meaning" field. This encourages active recall and contextual understanding.
- *Customizable Fields:*  Includes the following fields for comprehensive vocabulary learning:
    - =Word=: The word you are learning.
    - =Sound=:  Pronunciation information (e.g., IPA, audio file link).
    - =WordClass=:  Part of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).
    - =Meaning=: Definition and example sentences.
    - =ClozeForm=:  An optional field for an alternative cloze form of the word (e.g., a different inflection).
    - =Mnemonic=:  A memory aid to help you remember the word.
    - =Hint=:  An optional hint to help you recall the word.
    - =Extra=:  A field for any additional information (e.g., etymology, related words).
